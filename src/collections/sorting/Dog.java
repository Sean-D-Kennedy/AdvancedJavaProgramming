    /* API:
        The natural ordering for a class C is said to be consistent with equals if and only if 
        e1.compareTo(e2) == 0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 of class C. 
        It is strongly recommended (though not required) that natural orderings be consistent with equals. 
        This is so because sorted sets (and sorted maps) without explicit comparators behave "strangely" when 
        they are used with elements (or keys) whose natural ordering is inconsistent with equals. */
